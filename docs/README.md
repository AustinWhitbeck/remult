- title: Always Type-safe 
  details: The same type-safe coding style can be used to find and manipulate data in both frontend and backend code.

  details: Use Remult together with React, Angular, Vue.js, or any other UI framework.

- title: Easy Setup
  details: Bootstrap in minutes with an Express.js middleware in the backend and an http client wrapper in the frontend.
