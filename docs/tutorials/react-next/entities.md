# Entities 

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:
* As a model class for client-side code
* As a model class for server-side code
* By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated UUID `id` field a `title` field and a `completed` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `src/shared/` folder, with the following code:

*src/shared/Task.ts*
```ts
import { Entity, Fields } from "remult";

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: true
})
export class Task {
    @Fields.uuid()
    id!: string;

    @Fields.string()
    title = '';

    @Fields.boolean()
    completed = false;
}
```

3. In the server's `api` module, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `createRemultServer()` method:

*src/server/api.ts*
```ts{2,5}
import { createRemultServer } from "remult/server";
import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

export const api = createRemultServer({
    entities: [Task]
})
```

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial. 

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The `@Fields.uuid` decorator tells Remult to automatically generate an id using `uuid`. We mark this property as optional so we can create new `Task` objects without assigning an `id` at first, and have Remult generate one before the object's data is stored to the backend database.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/ref_field.md) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

## Seed Test Data

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can use it to seed the database with some test data.

Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/api.ts`.

*src/server/api.ts*
```ts{6-17}
import { createRemultServer } from "remult/server";
import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

export const api = createRemultServer({
    entities: [Task],
    initApi: async remult => {
        const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
        if (await taskRepo.count() === 0) {
            await taskRepo.insert([
                { title: "Task a" },
                { title: "Task b", completed: true },
                { title: "Task c" },
                { title: "Task d" },
                { title: "Task e", completed: true }
            ]);
        }
    }
})
```

The `initApi` callback is called only once, after a database connection is established and the server is ready to perform initialization operations.

`taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create `Task` entity objects.

The code in `initApi` simply adds five new Tasks to the database if the current `count` is zero.

Saving the changes will cause the server to restart and seed the database with the test data. Navigate to the `tasks` API route at <http://localhost:3000/api/tasks> to see the data.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.

## Display the Task List
Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in a React component.

Replace the contents of `pages/index.tsx` with the following code:

*pages/index.tsx*
```tsx
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { remult } from 'remult';
import { Task } from '../src/shared/Task';

async function fetchTasks() {
  return remult.repo(Task).find();
}

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTasks().then(setTasks);
  }, []);
  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        {tasks.map(task => (
          <div key={task.id}>
            <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
            {task.title}
          </div>
        ))}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

* The `fetchTasks` function uses the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server.
* `tasks` is a Task array React state to hold the list of tasks.
* React's useEffect hook is used to call `fetchTasks` once when the React component is loaded.

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.

### Add Styles

Optionally, make the app look a little better by replacing the contents of `styles/globals.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/react-vite-express-starter/completed-tutorial/src/index.css).
